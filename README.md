# Deploy to EKS with VB.Net

[Pulumi](https://pulumi.com/) has support for the .NET Framework.

We generate language SDKs for all of our providers for all the languages that DotNet supports. VB.Net is one of those languages.

This of course means that using Pulumi, you can deploy to Kubernetes with VB.Net

You probably shouldn't though
